 #### . <u>I- Through the deployed version over netlify:</u> 
 This is the simplest of way of running the project as it doesn’t require any pre installations or configurations. You just visit this [link](https://reaktor-pre-assignment.netlify.app/) you just need a good browser to run it.

 #### . <u>II-Through your local machine:</u> 
 
 Prerequisites:
- You need to have Nodejs installed in your machine, in case you don’t have Nodejs  installed in your machine, See these instructions from Nodejs website.

 Running the project:
- Download the ZIP folder of the project from this Github repository  
- Go to the directory of the project through CMD or terminal then run the command ``` npm install ```
- Run the command ``` npm start ``` and you will be able to browse the project on the default port 3000 (http://localhost:3000)

# 4. How to use the project
This proejct is simple, you just view the starting games and the ending games through the main page, as well as the historical results by game or by player in the modal.

# 5. Technologies Used:
* <b>Axios:</b> This is a better libaray to generate requests to the backend
* <b>Websocket:</b> For fetching data from the web socket API
* <b>Styled-components:</b> Instead of css files and classes, I used mostly styled-components in which they are just JS files they all end with SC (stands for Styled Components). They make the design convenient and easier and ease a lot of confusion.


# 6. Rejected solutions:
* <b>Fetch:</b> axios is much better and faster than fetch and a lot of developers started switching to axios.

# 7. Challenges and Problems:
The main challenge and problem is when it came to the testing as unfortunately I don't have much experience when when it comes to testing in React frontend. I will soon start taking online courses and tutorials about this.
